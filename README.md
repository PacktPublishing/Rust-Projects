# Rust-Projects
This is the code repository for [Rust Projects [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/in/programming/rust-projects-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
The Rust programming language is a boon for systems programmers because of its powerful and expressive type system and strict compile-time static analysis. Still, there are best practices to follow and idioms that the community has developed over time. This course tackles testing, building and distributing applications, and other real-world challenges using Rust, Cargo, and the Rustup toolchain manager.
You will build four projects, including a search tool, a Markdown parser, a chat server and client, and a blog. In this course, we’ll progress from command line applications, built with proper command line argument parsing and error handling, to more complex applications like a GUI text editor and several web applications. We’ll explore asynchronous programming and concurrent programming in Rust using real-world scenarios like file searching and stress testing. Finally, we’ll build a simple web app that interacts with a database in a type-safe manner using Diesel.
By the end of the course, you will be adept with the knowledge of Rust to practically implement it in real-world projects. You’ll know enough to build high-quality software that can be shared with the rest of the Rust community or even used in production.
